    "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic.As of 4 May 2020, more than 3.52 million cases have been reported across 187 countries and territories, resulting in more than 248,000 deaths. More than 1.13 million people have recovered.\n",
